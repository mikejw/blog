(For the record, I have at least come to my senses about this need in a production situation.)&nbsp; A great example of this is layman, which I think is fair to say is a slightly more intuitive version of managing an apt sources file.&nbsp; Today I realised there is a portage overlay (for use with layman) that I have been missing out on and perhaps it\'s because it\'s a fairly recent addition but it comes just in time for me to try and get more serious about hacking in Perl.</p>\r\n<p>With the perl-experimental overlay I anticipated the knock-on effect might be that I am no longer tempted to write a script for keeping my /etc/portage/package.keywords file sorted alphabetically automatically.&nbsp; I was half-right (thanks to a useful awk command from the Gentoo wiki) but in the end this need paled in significance compared to the delights of coming across a more up-to-date utility for handling cpan builds and then ending up with a system for reliably predicting where generated ebuilds from this utility will land in the filesystem. Not that it matters that much, I suppose.</p>\r\n<p>If you\'re new to overlays, these are the steps for setting up perl-experimental on a fresh Gentoo system:</p>\r\n<pre># emerge layman<br /># emerge dev-util/git<br /># layman -a perl-experimental<br /></pre>\r\n<p>At this point I had to run the following before I could eix-sync/eix-update or use emerge --search:</p>\r\n<pre># emerge --regen</pre>\r\n<p>The next thing is updating your /etc/make.conf file so that portage will be aware of layman specific ebuilds. Add this line to the end:</p>\r\n<pre>source /usr/local/portage/layman/make.conf</pre>\r\n<p>Now to (optionally) unmask packages in the overlay you can use the following awky goodness, as documented in the official Gentoo wiki...</p>\r\n<pre># ls -1 /usr/local/portage/layman/perl-experimental/dev-perl/ | \\<br />&nbsp;  awk \'{ print \"dev-perl/\" $1 \" ~x86\"}\' \\<br />   &nbsp;&gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.keywords</pre>\r\n<p>In order for upgrading to Perl 5.10 I had to add the following to the same file (package.keywords):</p>\r\n<pre>dev-lang/perl **</pre>\r\n<p>And I also had to append this to /etc/portage/package.unmask:</p>\r\n<pre>&gt;=dev-lang/perl-5.10.1<br /></pre>\r\n<p>As I mentioned earlier I was then on the look out for installing some Perl modules using cpan and I was happily trying to do this with g-cpan until it stopped working and I was pointed in the direction of cpan2dist by the guys in #gentoo-perl.&nbsp; After reading the documentation for this module on the CPAN website, installing it and playing around with it a bit I realised that a sensible thing to do might be to create a separate local overlay for it. This meant:</p>\r\n<pre># mkdir /usr/local/portage/cpan<br /></pre>\r\n<p>And then adding into /etc/make.conf after the line mentioned above:</p>\r\n<pre>PORTDIR_OVERLAY=\"/usr/local/portage/cpan$PORTDIR_OVERLAY\"<br /></pre>\r\n<p>Soon I might create some kind of script to run calls to cpan2dist so I don\'t forget to add the overlay path as follows:</p>\r\n<pre># cpan2dist --format CPANPLUS::Dist::Gentoo \\<br />    --buildprereq --dist-opts overlay=/usr/local/portage/cpan \\<br />    [module you want to build]</pre>\r\n<p>After doing all that you should see a corresponding overlay number eg. \"[1]\" next to the ebuilds that are in the new cpan overlay when you next run eix [module name] to those that are listed by the overlays after running eix-update.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',NULL),

The library will be aware that it might need to substitute parts of the any required numeric values for the placeholders defined in the full API call. &nbsp;The paramerters in the second arguement are \'expoliated\' to from a signature with which to cache the results of the call.</span></p></pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','elib'),

Then I would run the <a href=\"http://cs.sensiolabs.org/\">PHP Coding Standards Fixer </a> without any additional arguments on the command line as such:</p>\r\n<pre>$ php-cs-fixer fix ./file.php</pre>\r\n<p>The new form of the above class would then be more like this:</p>\r\n<pre>class front extends UserController\r\n{\r\n    public function default_event()\r\n    {\r\n        if ($this-&gt;isXMLHttpRequest()) {\r\n            header(\'Content-type: application/json\');\r\n            $message = \'\';\r\n            if (isset($_POST[\'code\']) &amp;&amp; ctype_digit($_POST[\'code\'])) {\r\n                $messages_arr = array(\r\n                    \'May onions grow out of your ears for two years!\',\r\n                    \'May the last page of the next book you read turn blank so you never find out the ending.\',\r\n                    \'May your next white wash have a red sock in it.\',\r\n                    \'May the dog eat your homework.\');\r\n                $code = (string) $_POST[\'code\'];\r\n                if (strlen($code) == 5) {\r\n                    $message = $messages_arr[rand(0, sizeof($messages_arr)-1)];\r\n                }\r\n                echo json_encode($message);\r\n            } else {\r\n                echo json_encode(\'\');\r\n            }\r\n            exit();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (isset($_POST[\'forward\']) &amp;&amp; $_POST[\'forward\'] == \"1\") {\r\n            $this-&gt;redirect(\'login\');\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Edit 01/02/2013: I have since learnt that this is called using \'K&amp;R\' bracing, named after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_%28book%29\">one of my favourite programming books</a>!</p>','style'),

I personally think this sure speaks volumes for the technology after already using it for various projects for around a year because, as a result, it\'s reconfirming it\'s ability to provide \'schemaless\' development compared to other ORM technologies. (See DBIx::Class, Doctrine, ActiveRecord etc). Being a Composer convert I automatically wanted to have my models residing in a \'namespaced location\' inside my (Empathy) web apps so that they could be auto loaded for me. Although I appreciate the RedBean creator\'s <a href=\"http://redbeanphp.com/extra/php_5_3_namespaces\">views</a> on namespaces in PHP, because I think less is often more, I\'ve simply always been a fan, especially since I started to use Composer and becoming aware of the <a href=\"https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md\">PSR 0 autoloading standard</a>. So assuming I have some \'Acme\' components in my web app I would declare them according to the composer <a href=\"http://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading\">documentation</a> as such:</p>\r\n<pre>{\r\n    \"autoload\": {\r\n        \"psr-0\": {\"Acme\": \"src/\"}\r\n    }\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>I could then have my models stored in \'src/Acme/Models\' but how would RedBean and specifically&nbsp;the event listener that belongs to FUSE know about them?

This class (that resides in the same location) would then be loaded and registered with RedBean in my application controller superclass as such:</p>\r\n<pre>require(\'ModelFormatter.php\');\r\n\\RedBean_ModelHelper::setModelFormatter(new \\ModelFormatter());\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>And the contents of this class:</p>\r\n<pre>class ModelFormatter implements RedBean_IModelFormatter\r\n{\r\n    public function formatModel($model)\r\n    {\r\n        $model = \'\\\\Acme\\\\Models\\\\Model\'.ucfirst($model);\r\n        return $model;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>The model classes themselves would then look like this:</p>\r\n<pre>namespace Acme\\Models;\r\n\r\nclass ModelFoo extends \\RedBean_SimpleModel\r\n{\r\n    public function dispense()\r\n    {\r\n        //echo \"I\'m a shiny new bean with a namespaced model class!\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</pre>','redbeanmodels'),

I had the idea in the bath this morning and it was probably due to the strong coffee I had drunk, which I bought from an independent coffee bean outlet in Camden, from which I (uncharacteristically for me these days) sampled again, because we&rsquo;re out of decaffeinated tea at the moment. The idea was for a start-up that takes the shape of a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to bring global stories to the forefront of people&rsquo;s attention that concern the successful collaboration between corporations and charities (and other not-for-profits) in the fight against the effects of globalisation, global economic instability and environmental issues... phew!</p>\r\n<p>The agenda in which to bring to the fore might include documenting successful projects in these areas:</p>\r\n<pre>- Poverty/food/medical aid.\r\n- Clean energy.\r\n- Education.\r\n- The arts.\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>The goal would be to create the engaging stories themselves by teaming creative people with the individual production efforts, which would have an emphasis on maintaining a natural style of reporting but maybe be fused with a good soundtrack and just basically be dope little films or well written pieces of journalism.

(Not very unfair.) Obviously the unique selling point would be to offer corporations a disrupted social media/content strategy that might curtail the status quo of advertising, which I feel, often seems to waste good money on bombarding the public with frivolous aspiration-based stimuli when it could be sponsoring the manifestation of tangible outcomes that everyone could celebrate together.</p>','goodnews'),

(27,3,1,'2013-06-24 12:37:58','Getting Agile Around Happiness','<p>A few months ago, after I had explained what I knew about the Agile software development process to a girlfriend of mine (who was showing a keen interest in how that kind of thing worked) she joked that as a user she would like some Marmite, for the benefit of her breakfast.</p>\r\n<p>This was hugely amusing (and endearing) of course that she should take such a cutsie approach to summarising the apparent backwards nature of it. Afterall, if Agile truly is the silver bullet of productivity then how come it feels so unnatural to apply it directly to a situation in which you yourself are the &ldquo;end user&rdquo; or &ldquo;main actor&rdquo;. Shouldn&rsquo;t this miracle process be universally effective and also not foster any sense of silliness even when the end goal is quite a trivial one?</p>\r\n<p>When it was declared that Marmite was a requirement for breakfast in that pretend user story we were already in bed and about to go to sleep. Any task that could be identified to helping ensure Marmite was indeed available at breakfast was unlikely to be that feasible to complete at such short notice and similarly so, even for a task to determine if Marmite was already available. Neither of which were going to be easily prioritised over getting some sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Today it seems Agile is hot. With all kinds of organisations (and governments) looking to do things the Agile way to achieve as much as possible in an age of austerity where maximum efficiency is essential and blah blah blah. This may all be due to a \'misreading\' of Agile - Agile is about moving goalposts! However this doesn&rsquo;t surprise me or make me feel uncomfortable because unlike other topics to do with software development I have never had any formal training in it but rather it is something I have learnt *culturally* within organisations, usually where there is either an existing SCRUM system in place or the one is about to be implemented; sometimes by borrowing concepts from other product development processes. (i.e. Kanban.)</p>\r\n<p>Fast forward to today (a few months later) I am no longer with that person, I am back living with mum (I will be 33 in a couple of months) I am outside the city, I feel lost, broken, confused and the most distressing thing of all is that I have been in this situation many times before.</p>\r\n<p>In order to address this. (I really want stop this from happening) I am finally getting referred to have a course of CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), which I believe will help me deal with negative thoughts and feelings and hopefully help me manage the stress of living with PVFS. (Post-viral fatigue syndrome.) This a condition similar to M.E. where mental or physical exertion can leave me feeling very drained of energy and when I&rsquo;m working hard on something it can be very difficult just getting through a week doing the absolute minimum of other things. This obviously can take it&rsquo;s toll on intimate relationships I am in with others but also I&rsquo;m sure at this stage, friendships, bands and work itself. In fact I&rsquo;m starting to realise that every single relationship I have with other human beings will probably be improved if I can get a handle of my negative thoughts/feelings through the application of CBT techniques. Also - and I must stress that I&rsquo;m a complete beginner with this stuff except for working once at a company who offered private CBT courses online - I believe that there could potentially be benefits for me with CBT that are nothing to do with me having PVFS.</p>\r\n<p>Other less formal ways of looking for happiness in my life have included self-hypnosis, a small amount of reading into NLP and gradually learning bits of information about Buddhism, it&rsquo;s many different antidotal forms of meditation and eventually Yoga.</p>\r\n<p>I would say these last two have been most effective in helping me. Buddhism eventually helped me realise that there are practical ways of dealing with unhappiness and even though I never became a self-proclaimed Buddhist I feel these days that I armed with a small toolkit of practices that are good for coping and calming. Yoga has been amazingly helpful at directly alleviating the symtoms, which are felt physically and it was also a joy in discovering the very real feeling of purifying my body and thusly my mind. Shamone.</p>\r\n<p>However the tricky thing with being into Buddhism and Yoga is that it&rsquo;s like being interested in becoming a great drummer, (nothing I have ever claimed to be - but I do feel I have received the necessary training) you need plenty space in which to do it and you have the feeling that no-one wants to see you while you&rsquo;re busy at it. (Let alone hear you.)</p>\r\n<p>So what else is available to me in terms of a serious practice that can improve my life? Well hopefully CBT but that&rsquo;s being set up for me through the NHS and inevitably will take some hoop jumping before it&rsquo;s up and running. NLP? When I read into this years ago I was super intrigued by it and before long I felt like it was starting to help me communicate with my girlfriend at that time but it also brought with it a very eery feeling. I felt it was encouraging me to robotize my communication so that nothing I said or conveyed wasn&rsquo;t based on the last received signal from the person I was talking to. Perhaps there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for that level of intimacy in communication with someone but what scared me was how quickly I was suddenly able to appease the other person and appear make them happy but I wasn&rsquo;t saying anything to them about how I really felt. Was NLP suggesting that the best form of communication is where everybody hides their real feelings from each other? I didn&rsquo;t trust it.</p>\r\n<p>So this brings me to today.. I&rsquo;m having some time off from work for the first time since I started my current job and before that I was scrambling around for two months trying to find work in a completely dried up contract market, so really, this is my first down-time for half a year! I definitely feel like I have made some progress along the way, getting here but I&rsquo;ve decided that I want to try and use a more structured approach to getting back onto a path more befitting a 33 year old. I.e. not living at home and ideally maybe meeting someone nice who isn&rsquo;t too adverse to the idea of settling down one day.</p>\r\n<p>Considering that I have been told in the past explicitly by one of the (many) Agile Gurus I have encountered along the path, which is my web development career: Agile can be applied to *anything*. It can be used to bootstrap an organisation.</p>\r\n<p>So, with this in mind I have decided to create for a &lsquo;project&rsquo; for myself called &ldquo;Happiness&rdquo; in which I will be the client, project manager, and developer. As a result of some inner-investigation I will create user stories and related sub tasks to be carried out by myself. If anything interesting happens along the way I&rsquo;ll write some more about it.</p>\r\n<p>(Inner) Peace.</p>','asahuman'),

The irony here is kind of intentional because not many of these are widely considered to be that sexy. Hint: &nbsp;From an engineering perspective I believe best practices usually trump new and shiny.</p>\r\n<p>1. <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch01s02.html.en\">GNU/Linux</a>.</p>\r\n<p>No explanation required.</p>\r\n<p>2. <a href=\"http://www.perl.org/\">Perl</a></p>\r\n<p>Perl was the first ever programming language (apart from BASIC) that I ever laid eyes on. &nbsp;Back in the day, around 1999, when I had first started to tinker with web technologies in my spare time I had figured out that I could upload publically available Perl/CGI scripts to my shared hosting account and give my sites instant functionality such as a guest book or form-to-email processing. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t really imagine at that time that one day I would be able to write Perl code myself because it looked pretty nuts. &nbsp;However as a high-level programming language that people still use it&rsquo;s clearly had the longest amount of time to grow on me. Also, CPAN.</p>\r\n<p>3. <a href=\"http://php.net/\">PHP</a></p>\r\n<p>During the foundation year of my degree in 2003, which I started as a mature student but didn&rsquo;t finish &nbsp;(yes I said foundation year - I had to learn and subsequently forget calculus at some point, right?) I bought a book on beginning to develop using the LAMP stack. &nbsp;So it was basically a simple cookbook of PHP and MySQL recipes. &nbsp;I had already started to use Linux as my main desktop OS. &nbsp;(Slackware/Redhat 9.) &nbsp;Following the steps in this book I was suddenly able to make CMS-driven websites from scratch. &nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t learnt C, C++ or Java at this point but when I did I became big into PHP 5 and Object Oriented Programming, which was then a brand new feature. &nbsp; I also started to become interested in frameworks starting with Ruby on Rails. &nbsp;In 2005 I got my first part-time programming job thanks to hookups through the Greater London Linux User Group (GLLUG) mailing list. &nbsp;I still like PHP because, apart from it&rsquo;s foibles, &nbsp;it&rsquo;s basically a C-like specialist language for backend web development and it happens to have matured as I have as a backend developer and probably at about the same rate.</p>\r\n<p>4.<a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\"> PostgreSQL</a></p>\r\n<p>I believe PostgreSQL is the king of the relational database world. &nbsp;There isn&rsquo;t anything I&rsquo;ve seen any other RDBMS do that postgres can&rsquo;t handle. &nbsp;I believe in the notion that it&rsquo;s more true to the official SQL spec than most others and I still feel there&rsquo;s lots for me to learn about it. &nbsp;Also I&rsquo;ve seen horrible things done with it but not as horrible as MS SQL.</p>\r\n<p>4. <a href=\"http://www.redmine.org/\">RedMine</a></p>\r\n<p>I love RedMine because of it&rsquo;s simplicity despite being a RoR app. &nbsp;My experience tells me that if you really care about adopting an Agile software development process the most important thing is applying a KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) mentality all the way. &nbsp;I understand there may be more comprehensive Agile tools out there but if your organisation isn&rsquo;t even doing Continuous Integration properly then who cares.</p>\r\n<p>5. <a href=\"http://www.redbeanphp.com/\">RedBean</a></p>\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know of a non-NoSQL technology as cool as Redbean, especially when combined with the above (Postgres) due to performance. During development stages it forces you to keep your database schema in your head the entire time and it has the rare quality of wanting to stay out of your way as much as possible while also actively encouraging you to keep a normalised database design. The only thing that&rsquo;s probably better is Perl&rsquo;s DBIx::Class but I don&rsquo;t get to use that enough.</p>\r\n<p>6. <a href=\"http://phpunit.de/\">PHPUnit</a></p>\r\n<p>The unit testing framework that taught me unit testing before I properly started to learn about software testing as more of a discipline. What excites me about PHPUnit currently is that I know that it supports lots of different styles of testing and it&rsquo;s very extensible. &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t found the time yet or quite the need to get it to perform the myriad of things it can do but I&rsquo;m sure it will be very satisfying when I get around to it. Also the code coverage extension works well and look great.</p>\r\n<p>7. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\">JavaScript</a></p>\r\n<p>I love JavaScript mostly because of JSON. There&rsquo;s something pretty exciting about creating a PHP based REST-ful API/web service that speaks JSON especially when it&rsquo;s based on all of the above technologies (apart from RedMine and Perl) including using PHPUnit from which to perform system testing.</p>\r\n<p>Also Node.js is pretty cool. Node.js is a backend technology by the way. It&rsquo;s amazing how often that gets confused. I&rsquo;d definitely like to be involved in some more projects that use it but I\'d be quite fussy about having strict coding conventions, a TDD approach and a system architecture - especially if complex - that was geared around an \"event-hub\" style design. Otherwise the benefits of using the technology would probably feel lost. Also apparently you can do some quite cool stuff with JavaScript on the front-end too. &nbsp;I just wish I had got to learn MooTools properly before it went out of fashion!</p>','sexy'),

The software depends on \"elib-base\" and <a href=\"http://empathyphp.co.uk\">Empathy</a> and these are the same three main components that this site also depends on (as well as the templating library Smarty). The three components can now all be installed using Composer however elib-blog is not currently a stable enough project to be public. I have also been working towards a new release of Empathy (version 0.9.6) which will include updated documentation. All information regarding this micro-framework is gradually starting to be stockpiled over at <a href=\"http://empathyphp.co.uk\">empathyphp.co.uk</a>. (Notice the attempt at making the project look as official as possible.) Be warned that finalising the next release is still in progress and the same is true for the accompanying docs.</p>\r\n<p>Attempting to see things as objectively as possible, I\'m pretty pleased that setting up a new blog using this stack of easily installable components went so well and I can\'t help but wonder how long it would have taken me to put together something similar using Wordpress and be as happy with the overall result - even though I admit that what I was looking for was ultimately quite minimal in terms of features. The main things I cared about implementing were multiple categories, a blog archive widget, responsive layout (that still needs some improvement), SEO friendly URLs, RSS feed, site SEO settings, caching mechanism and of course a simple secured admin area for managing blog posts themselves. Eventually I began to start to feel freed up to start planning some really killer features (jokes) like a cartoon cat that will pop up and say random things to site visitors.

(39,3,1,'2015-04-07 00:44:25','Real Fears','<p>Today I realised something pretty insanely important. I feel like I&rsquo;ve always known, growing up, that my main problem/challenge/struggle/issue/difficulty (whatever you want to call it) in life has been coping with a core belief in me from when I was a child that has lead to a &ldquo;fear of abandonment&rdquo;. Unfortunately I must accept this is going to be a life-long struggle to cope with. Just like other more physical or physiological problems.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from never really understanding the issue very well - not well enough to accept that it may be genuine phobia of mine. The really troubling aspect to this problem is that, call me a cop-out if you want but it seems to me if you have this issue then you are most likely to be going to be attacked because of it from those who are responsible for imparting it on you.</p>\r\n<p>Today after about ten minutes of quick Duck-Duck-Going (Googling) I found myself suddenly quite shocked to find that it is apparently a condition that, first of all, isn&rsquo;t that uncommon. So much so that some believe it is an issue that is potentially wired into our collective subconscious as humans via mythology.</p>\r\n<p>More interesting and perhaps believable was finding that it is clearly considered a genuine phobia for sufferers and more interesting still was getting a quick sense of what the standard treatments for it might involve. It wasn&rsquo;t a shock to learn that some standard cognitive therapy type treatments out there may exist that probably aim to help people recognise the negative thought patterns that can exist within, so that they may be recognised, dealt with, challenged or easily dismissed by the individual as an ongoing process of a CBT-style &lsquo;becoming one&rsquo;s own doctor&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>What is most profound to me is learning that it is completely recognised that people who suffer from this phobia often grow up with feelings of not belonging to a group or a &lsquo;pack&rsquo; and that the recommended way of dealing with that is by spending time analysing one&rsquo;s own passions and dreams in life and then making it an ongoing mission to find people who share these and therefore find people to be surrounded by who can directly or indirectly provide support for the individual.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing to me when I think about this because similar to other treatments I&rsquo;ve ended up finding relief from in life, this kind of recommended process of &ldquo;tribe-finding&rdquo; is something that I&rsquo;ve definitely tried to explore since I was a teenager, perhaps knowing intuitively that it must be the antidote required for a happier life. It does make me wonder though Nick Hornby style: &ldquo;Am I sad because I listen to pop music or do I listen to pop music because I&rsquo;m sad.&rdquo; As in do I love the things in life that I do because I just do or because I figured the people who do those things would make a cool crew to hang out with and therefore will not have to face being alone. (Cries.)</p>\r\n<p>Wait that&rsquo;s getting a bit meta. Let&rsquo;s just assume that my passions in life are genuine and normal. After all photography experts weren&rsquo;t that cool when I was a teenager. They were just grey haired men who hung out in dark rooms.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to music though, which is a bigger passion now, what other sense of belonging can possibly exist for a person than being in a band and maybe being lucky enough to go on the road and travel and really live the ultimate pack-like fantasies? I suppose it shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to me when I think of of how much of a relief it was when I was eighteen and finally started doing music more seriously. Although that may have been because I also found people I could do music with who definitely shared my world-view and who were also my family as a massive added bonus. (Big families are awesome). I&rsquo;ve often found myself joking to people who ask me about my musical exploits that the basic need for it comes from the innate ability a band can provide in free group therapy from within a surrogate dysfunctional family setting. Aside from all that creative razzamatazz.</p>\r\n<p>What I am learning now - still the hard way it seems - is how super easily this ugly fear that resides in me can rear it&rsquo;s head when I&rsquo;m feeling only moderately insecure. But most crucially though is realising that I am equally prone to falling into the worst of these imaginary abandonment traps when the relationship(s) in question that I am fearful of losing are professional ones.</p>\r\n<p>This is pretty big deal as realisations go and I am feeling super lucky right know to have finally put these missing pieces of the jigsaw together. How else can things routinely go so wrong for a person when I have been lucky enough to intuitively reach out and try and join a pack of humans because I love what they do - but can also provide me with a career. I have been so lucky in having some extremely supportive people as my superiors over the years and even more amazing is considering that some of these have come along while working on a contract/freelancer basis.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe now, with this in mind, I can finally start to realise that it cannot simply be success alone or achieving things that I am afraid of. It all boils down to the relationships that are part and parcel of that struggle.</p>\r\n<p>These days computer geeks can&rsquo;t seem to get enough of spending time with each other as separate inner tribes and crazily you could argue that the outcome of these tribal communities has a direct correlation to the content of the training programs of most IT recruiters and the distillation of which probably leads to the buzzword frenzied modus operandi of the whole industry maybe even cyclically both industries. Recruiters though are people, I&rsquo;m learning, are some of the most important people that I need to relate to on Earth. If only one of them would take me seriously when I say that I am drawn to technologies often simply because of the communities behind them and not just because of the technology itself.</p>','fears'),

(43,2,1,'2015-07-22 12:56:03','Another week another PHP technical test','<p>Due to working on a test for a new potential role, I&rsquo;ve been made to take a slightly deeper look into using database calls with mysqli (the MySQL Improved extension).</p>\r\n<p>I admit that since acquiring an official fave object-relational-mapping tool for PHP - <a href=\"http://www.redbeanphp.com/\">Redbean</a> - I have stopped caring too much about lower level differences in PHP database abstractions libraries/extensions because Redbean like many others just uses PDO. I hadn&rsquo;t, for instance, realised that parameter binding is perfectly possible with PDO and has been for quite some time.</p>\r\n<p>When I first saw mysqli in action, this feature was apparently still quite new in PDO, which explains why I might have been persuaded that it wasn&rsquo;t supported at all. Since then it has stayed with me that, for this reason, mysqli is more secure (from SQL injection attacks) but now I realise the only difference seems to be that it can be slightly more performant than PDO as long as fully hard coding an application to just use MySQL as a database dependency is a-ok with you.</p>\r\n<p>So I&rsquo;ve ended up looking at mysqli prepared statements, keen to lay some groundwork, in order to have some code that I could potentially use as a proof of concept for showing that mysqli can outperform a very lightweight PDO active-record style and extreme legacy code ORM of mine. Of which I feel awkwardly proud to say hasn&rsquo;t changed much in almost ten years. Probably because even though crude, it has been at the heart of many projects, pretty much unchanged and therefore a beacon of my understanding of backwards compatibly issues that have affected the surrounding code it lives in.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as I got into parameter binding, I naturally wanted to create a little wrapper function for my querying (around mysqli procedural calls) and this led to the use of PHPs \"call_user_func\" callback method, &nbsp;so that I could send arbitrary length parameter lists. The documentation warns of potential difficulties with parameter binding as these are expected to be in the form of references. I didn&rsquo;t realise at first how much of a due warning was necessary. It turned out it was pretty justified. There is quite a lot of hits out there on the subject of references in php and particularly with foreach loops. i.e. when creating (and reusing) a loop like this:</p>\r\n<pre>foreach ($data as &amp;$item) {\r\n    // some stuff\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>Before I got to the conclusion provided by momslatin_dadsasian on the &lsquo;lolphp&rsquo; subreddit, which I am now newly acquainted with:</p>\r\n<blockquote>My general rule with foreach and references is: fuck php and use something else</blockquote>\r\n<p>I persevered believing that what I was trying to achieve MUST be possible. I won&rsquo;t try and explain the deal with references and foreach loops but in a nutshell it seems these references both exist outside of the foreach loop and also don&rsquo;t exist at the same time. Or another way of looking at it seems to be a reference will exist but only if you attempt to observe it and even then it will be in a slightly different place.</p>\r\n<p>Suffice to say I didn&rsquo;t feel like learning quantum theory in order to execute a pretty straightforward technical test for a part time web development job. So I quickly hacked together a different approach. So instead of this:</p>\r\n<pre>$refs = array();\r\nforeach ($foo as $bar){ \r\n    $refs[] =&amp; $bar;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>I tried this and I was rewarded with the expected behaviour.</p>\r\n<pre>$refs = array();\r\nforeach ($foo as $index =&gt; $bar) {\r\n    $refs[] =&amp; $foo[$index];\r\n}\r\n</pre>','refhell'),
